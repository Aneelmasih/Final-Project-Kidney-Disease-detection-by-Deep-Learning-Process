# Image Classification using Transfer Learning

This project uses deep learning models like ResNet50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 for image classification. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- Image preprocessing with Keras
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
- Training and evaluation
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## Required Libraries

Make sure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
tensorflow
keras
opencv-python
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Pillow
```

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn Pillow
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells in order
